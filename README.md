## Supports

Works on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Code: Bash best practices

## IMPORTANT: Read before install

The script is based on this standard:

If you want to create a new web project for domain.com it will create:
* A database with name 'MYDOMAIN_STAGE' (the script will ask you the project stage). Ex: mydomain_prod
* A database user with name 'DOMAIN_user'. Ex: mydomain_user
* A directory for the project files named 'mydomain.com'.
* A nginx configuration for 'mydomain.com'.

So, the restore script only works if this nomenclature is respected.

## Installation

If git is not installed:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git -y
```

Configure the username, replace First Last:

```
git config --global user.name "First Last"
```

Configure the email, replace example@example.com:

```
git config --global user.email "example@example.com"
```

Cloning repo:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/broobe/all-in-one-backup-script
```

Change directories to the new ~/all-in-one-backup-script directory:

```
cd ~/all-in-one-backup-script
```

## Getting started

Give the execution permission to the script:

```bash
 $chmod +x runner.sh
```

Run it:

```bash
 ./runner.sh
```

The first time you run `runner.sh`, you'll be guided through a wizard in order to configure it. This configuration will be stored in `~/.broobe-utils-script`.

## Running as cron job
This script relies on a different configuration file for each system user. The default configuration file location is `root/.broobe-utils-script`.
This means that if you setup the script with your user and then you try to run a cron job as root, it won't work.
So, when running this script using cron, please keep in mind the following:
* Remember to setup the script with the user used to run the cron job
* Always specify the full script path when running it (e.g.  /path/to/dropbox_uploader.sh)

## Third Party Utils
